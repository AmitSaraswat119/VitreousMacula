a)	FrontEnd: We have made a simple Front-End which is easy is to use but pretty looking as well. We have designed our front end on Adobe xD and we have used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for the front end. 
b)	BackEnd : We have build a Machine Learning Model so we decided to use Flask as our backend framework. Since we are more familiar with python. We have deployed our model on the Heroku app.
